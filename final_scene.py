        The final showdown between {protagonist.name} and Big Boss was intense, with both fighters using every ounce of 
        strength and skill they had. In the end, the protagonist emerged victorious, standing over the defeated tyrant's
         body.
    
        As the news of Big Boss's defeat spread, the people of Xanthe rejoiced. No longer would they be held under the 
        thumb of a cruel and corrupt leader. The bartender, now free from Big Boss's clutches, was able to reunite with 
        his family, and {protagonist.name} bid farewell to the planet of Xanthe, ready to continue on his next adventure.
    
        The mission was complete, and {protagonist.name} knew that he had made a significant difference in the lives of 
        those on Xanthe. With a sense of pride and accomplishment, he left the planet, ready to tackle whatever 
        challenges lay ahead.\n
